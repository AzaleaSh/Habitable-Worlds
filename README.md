There are two code files and one long string of data.
The solar system habitable zone is a smaller project to test my code on answers that I know.
Secondly the habital worlds is the main, and using all the data from NASA exoplanet archive, it pulls only planets in habitable zones and then,
finds the shift in Velocity to each planet's star from each planet and then finds each planet's transit probability and transity density.
